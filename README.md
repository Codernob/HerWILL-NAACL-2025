**Abstract** Misogynistic memes on social media perpetuate gender stereotypes, contribute to harassment, and suppress feminist activism. However, most existing misogyny detection models focus on high-resource languages, leaving a gap in low-resource settings. This work addresses that gap by focusing on misogynistic memes in Tamil and Malayalam, two Dravidian languages with limited resources. We combine computer vision and natural language processing for multi-modal detection, using CLIP embeddings for the vision component and BERT models trained on code-mixed hate speech datasets for the text component. Our results show that this integrated approach effectively captures the unique characteristics of misogynistic memes in these languages, achieving competitive performance with a Macro F1 Score of 0.7800 for the Tamil test set and 0.8748 for the Malayalam test set. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal models and the adaptation of pre-trained models to specific linguistic and cultural contexts, advancing misogyny detection in low-resource settings.
